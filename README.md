Follow the [guide in Wiki section](https://github.com/EtheaDev/IconFontsImageList/wiki) to known how to use those components to modernize your Delphi VCL or FMX applications scalable, colored and beautiful with few lines of code.

## Very important notice:

**TVirtualImageList** (available from D10.3) and **TIconFontsVirtualImageList** both use images from **TIconFontsImageCollection**. An important difference is that TVirtualImageList may use and create only a subset of the images in the collection, whereas TIconFontsVirtualImageList creates all images of the collection everytime it is needed (e,g. DPI change), which is slower and consumes more memory.

We advise that TIconFontsVirtualImageList should be used only for versions of Delphi before 10.3. For recent versions of Delphi the recommended combination should be **TIconFontsImageCollection + TVirtualImageList**. Don't forget also the importance of TVirtualImageList.PreserveItems when you have a large ImageCollection with many linked Actions. Without setting this property to "True", everytime you add or remove an icon in the collection, you have to check and change the ImageIndex of all the Actions.

**Warning: "Material Font" has changed**

Take care of changed Font file used in the Demos from v1.7(VCL)/v1.2(FMX) -> v1.8(VCL)/v1.3(FMX), as explained [here](https://github.com/EtheaDev/IconFontsImageList/wiki/Deploy-Applications). 

If you are using the old Font, you can automatically convert icons to the new ones as explained [here](https://github.com/EtheaDev/IconFontsImageList/wiki/Convert-Material-Icons).
